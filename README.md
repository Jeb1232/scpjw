# SCP - Janitorial Work PGE Port

[Pulsegun](https://github.com/juanjp600/pge) engine port of the **SCP - Containment Breach** mod **SCP - Janitorial Work** which was coded initially in Blitz3D.

This engine lead to several limitations in terms of how complex the mod can be, and also limited graphical capabilities since it used DirectX 7. This port aims to fix those issues while keeping a clear codebase unlike the Blitz3D counterpart. 

This is still WIP and will probably be for a long time since version 0.1.5 will be done in the old engine, and then development for the port will fully begin.

## Building

Building requires [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) with C++ features and the [OpenAL SDK](https://www.openal.org/) (just like [SCP - Containment Breach 1.4](https://github.com/juanjp600/scpcb))

## Contributing

It would be nice if you could contribute to this port, since porting a mod of an already big game to a completely different engine and language is a hard task.
